    # The transport to use, either `jdk`, `native` or `io_uring`.
    # Native socket transport has higher performance and produces less garbage and are available on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
    # When set to `native` or `io_uring`, Play will automatically detect the operating system it is running on and load the appropriate native transport library.
    # On Windows, if set to `native` or `io_uring`, Play will ignore it and automatically fall back to Java NIO transport - just like when using the default `jdk` config.
    # On macOS, if set to `io_uring`, Play will fall back to `native` instead, because the `io_uring` transport is only available on Linux (using Kernel 5.14 or newer compiled with `CONFIG_IO_URING=y`).

    # For Linux native socket transport only:

    # When using `io_uring` native socket transport on Linux only:

        # "io.netty.channel.unix.UnixChannelOption#SO_REUSEPORT" = true
        # E.g. Linux only:
        # "io.netty.channel.epoll.EpollChannelOption#IP_BIND_ADDRESS_NO_PORT" = true
        # E.g. on Linux only when using the `io_uring` transport:
        # "io.netty.channel.uring.IoUringChannelOption#TCP_KEEPIDLE" = true
        # E.g. macOS/BSD only:
